# United-States-Employment-Data-Analysis
In the Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), we examined trends in United States employment in all 50 states. This analysis consisted of data preprocessing, visualization, simple time series, and regression.

# National Trend
When we first look at the national trend of Unemployment and Labor Force Participation(LFP), we see that rates have stayed relatively consistent, with a huge spike and dip in Unemployment and LFP rates, respectively, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

# States' Unemployment and Labor Force Participation Rates
The next part of this project was looking at which states have the highest and lowest Unemployment and Labor Force Participation rates from 1976-2022. We see that states with higher populations, like California, Illinois, and Michigan, have higher(median) unemployment rates than smaller states like Iowa, Vermont, and the Dakotas. Bigger states typically have more diverse industries, and more people actively in the labor market, contributing to higher numbers in unemployment. However, the state with the highest(median) unemployment was Alaska, which happens to be the third smallest state by population. There are many reasons why this is, but a big reason is that the economy is highly seasonal. Wyoming, the smallest state, has the lowest unemployment rate, as it is known for having a strong natural resource industry. Many states listed as having low unemployment rates also had some of the highest Labor Force Participation, like Nebraska, the Dakotas, Vermont, Iowa, and Wyoming. As expected, big states have lower labor force participation, like New York and Florida. Tennessee  has the lowest LFPR, and this is primarily because of an aging population.

# Highest Unemployment and Lowest Labor Force Participation Rates Recorded
Out of the top ten highest unemployment months in particular states, 3 of them occurred in April of 2020 across Nevada, Hawaii, and Michigan. Of the top ten highest recorded months, 7 occurred in 2020 dude to the mass layoffs/firings due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly enough, in January-March 1983, West Virginia had unemployment rates of about 15%. West Virginia's thriving oil, coal, and industrial industries suffered greatly from the recession, resulting in many people losing their jobs. This also explains why in much of 1983, and even in 1984, Labor Participation Rates dropped to 40% in West Virginia, recording some of the lowest in American history.

# Time Series
Using a random walk method, we generated predictions of unemployment rates up until 2036 for every state. This was based off of previous percent changes in unemployment rates.

# Conclusion
In this analysis, we looked at employment across America, and saw certain very important trends, such as the catastrophic national impact Covid had on workres. Also, we were able to identify trends that impacted individual states, such as the recession in West Virginia in the 1980's. I hope this brought important insight to employment trends in America.
